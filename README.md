### Sometimes you just wake up and feel like.. "Man I really wanna try writing some Assembly today"

Don't worry, you're never alone!

Just a few examples of how things work in x86 Assembly. All the things I wrote while discovering and learning things about the language out of curiosity and interest.

I wrote all of this on Windows, for Windows using NASMx86. Sooooo... This exact code will run only on Windows (probably) but the Concepts should stay the same.
